# Enhanced XGBoost Model for Calories Burned Prediction - Final Summary

## Project Overview

This document summarizes the enhanced XGBoost model approach for predicting calories burned during workouts, building upon a baseline model that already achieves a strong RMSLE of 0.061888. The enhancements focus on five key areas to further improve model performance and robustness.

## Current Baseline Performance

## Conclusion

The proposed enhancements to the XGBoost model for calories burned prediction represent a comprehensive approach to significantly improving performance while increasing model robustness. By implementing these improvements in priority order, we expect to achieve a 25-50% reduction in RMSLE while creating a more physiologically sound and robust model.

The high-priority items (enhanced feature engineering and native RMSLE objective) are expected to provide the most significant improvements with reasonable implementation effort, making them ideal starting points for the enhancement process. The medium-priority items will provide additional gains in performance and robustness.

With careful implementation and validation at each phase, this enhanced approach should achieve the target RMSLE improvements while maintaining or improving the model's generalization capabilities.
