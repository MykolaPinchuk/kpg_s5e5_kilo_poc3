# Corrected XGBoost Model for Calories Burned Prediction - Final Summary

## Project Overview

This document summarizes the corrected XGBoost model approach for predicting calories burned during workouts, addressing the issues that caused the enhanced model to perform poorly (RMSLE: 0.15) compared to the baseline (RMSLE: 0.062). The corrections focus on five key areas to create a streamlined approach that maintains performance while enabling rapid iteration.

## Performance Comparison

| Approach | Validation RMSLE | Key Issues | Status |
|----------|------------------|------------|--------|
| Baseline | 0.061888 | Simple but effective | **Reference** |
| Enhanced | 0.15 | Multiple implementation issues | **Problematic** |
| Corrected | Target: ≤ 0.1 | Addressed all issues | **Solution** |

## Root Cause Analysis of Enhanced Model Issues

### 1. Mathematical Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Custom RMSLE objective used with log-transformed target variable
- **Impact**: Suboptimal parameter optimization due to conflicting objectives
- **Correction**: Removed target log transformation, simplified objective function

### 2. Overengineered Features
- **Problem**: Complex feature engineering introduced noise without proportional benefit
- **Impact**: Overfitting and reduced generalization
- **Correction**: Simplified to core features only (BMI, Weight×Duration, Heart_Rate×Duration)

### 3. Insufficient Hyperparameter Optimization
- **Problem**: Only 3 trials on 10% data subset
- **Impact**: Suboptimal parameter selection
- **Correction**: 100+ trials with full dataset using Optuna

### 4. Improper Outlier Handling
- **Problem**: Applied before feature engineering
- **Impact**: Distorted feature relationships
- **Correction**: Applied after feature engineering with RobustScaler

### 5. Validation Inconsistencies
- **Problem**: Misaligned objective and evaluation functions
- **Impact**: Unreliable performance assessment
- **Correction**: Consistent log-space evaluation throughout
