# Calories Burned Prediction Model - Summary

## Implementation Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a baseline ML model for predicting calories burned during workouts using XGBoost.

## Data Processing

- **Data Sources**: 
  - Training data: `data/train_subsample.csv` (75,000 samples)
  - Test data: `data/test_subsample.csv` (25,000 samples)
  - Full test data: `data/test_full.csv` (for final submission)

- **Features**:
  - Original features: Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart_Rate, Body_Temp, Sex
  - Derived features: BMI, Weight_Duration, HeartRate_Duration, Age_Weight, MET
  - Categorical encoding: One-hot encoding for Sex (Gender_female, Gender_male)

## Model Implementation

- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Regressor
- **Objective**: `reg:squarederror`
- **Parameters**: 
  - n_estimators: 1000
  - max_depth: 6
  - learning_rate: 0.1
- **Training**: With early stopping (patience: 10 rounds)
- **Target Transformation**: Log transformation for RMSLE optimization

## Results

- **Validation RMSLE**: 0.061888
- **Target Achieved**: Yes (target was â‰¤ 0.1)
- **Training/Validation Split**: 80/20
