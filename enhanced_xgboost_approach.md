# Enhanced XGBoost Model Approach for Calories Burned Prediction

## Executive Summary

This document outlines an enhanced XGBoost model approach for predicting calories burned during workouts, building upon the existing baseline model that achieves an RMSLE of 0.061888. The enhancements focus on five key areas:

1. Improved feature engineering with physiologically accurate MET calculation
2. Additional interaction features and polynomial features for non-linear relationships
3. Better hyperparameter optimization with cross-validation
4. Native RMSLE objective in XGBoost
5. Regularization parameters and outlier handling

These improvements are expected to further reduce the RMSLE and create a more robust model.

## 1. Current Baseline Model Analysis

### Performance
- **Validation RMSLE**: 0.061888 (already below target of 0.1)
- **Features**: Sex, Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart_Rate, Body_Temp
- **Derived Features**: BMI, Weight_Duration, HeartRate_Duration, Age_Weight, MET
- **Model**: XGBoost with n_estimators=1000, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.1

### Key Observations
- HeartRate_Duration dominates feature importance (0.974), suggesting potential over-reliance on this single feature
- Current MET calculation is a simplified approximation rather than physiologically accurate
- No explicit regularization parameters are being used
- No specific outlier handling is implemented

## 2. Enhanced Feature Engineering

### 2.1 Physiologically Accurate MET Calculation

**Current Approach**: `MET = Heart_Rate / Age` (simplified approximation)

**Enhanced Approach**: 
- Use established formulas that consider activity type, body composition, and physiological factors
- Implement multiple MET calculations:
  1. **Standard MET**: Based on activity intensity levels
  2. **Adjusted MET**: Account for individual differences in efficiency
  3. **Dynamic MET**: Vary based on workout duration and intensity progression

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_physiological_met(heart_rate, age, weight, duration, body_temp):
    # Base metabolic rate calculation (Harris-Benedict equation)
    if gender == 'male':
        bmr = 88.362 + (13.397 * weight) + (4.799 * height) - (5.677 * age)
    else:
        bmr = 447.593 + (9.247 * weight) + (3.098 * height) - (4.330 * age)
    
    # Heart rate zone calculation
    max_hr = 220 - age
    hr_zone = heart_rate / max_hr
    
    # Activity-specific MET values (simplified)
    if duration < 10:
        base_met = 3.0  # Light activity
    elif duration < 30:
        base_met = 5.0  # Moderate activity
    else:
        base_met = 7.0  # Vigorous activity
    
    # Adjust for heart rate zone
    hr_adjustment = 1.0 + (hr_zone - 0.5) * 0.5 if hr_zone > 0.5 else 1.0
    
    # Adjust for body temperature
    temp_adjustment = 1.0 + (body_temp - 37.0) * 0.02 if body_temp > 37.0 else 1.0
    
    return base_met * hr_adjustment * temp_adjustment
```

### 2.2 Additional Interaction Features

**New Features**:
1. **HR_per_min**: `Heart_Rate / Duration` - Efficiency of heart rate over time
2. **Weight_per_min**: `Weight / Duration` - Weight distribution over workout duration
3. **Calories_per_min**: `Calories / Duration` - Intensity measure (for feature creation)
4. **HeartRate_BMI**: `Heart_Rate * BMI` - Cardiovascular demand relative to body mass

### 2.3 Polynomial Features for Non-linear Relationships

**Second-order polynomial features**:
- `Age^2`, `Height^2`, `Weight^2`, `Duration^2`
- `Heart_Rate^2`, `Body_Temp^2`
- Key interaction terms squared

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Use sklearn's `PolynomialFeatures` with degree=2
- Apply only to selected features to avoid explosion in dimensionality
- Use feature selection to identify most important polynomial terms

## 3. Enhanced Hyperparameter Optimization

### 3.1 Cross-Validation Strategy

**Current Approach**: Simple train/validation split

**Enhanced Approach**:
- Implement 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- Stratify by target quantiles to ensure distribution consistency
- Use TimeSeriesSplit if temporal patterns exist in data

### 3.2 Bayesian Optimization

**Implementation**:
- Use `optuna` or `scikit-optimize` for efficient hyperparameter search
- Define search space for key parameters:
  - `n_estimators`: [100, 2000]
  - `max_depth`: [3, 12]
  - `learning_rate`: [0.01, 0.3]
  - `subsample`: [0.6, 1.0]
  - `colsample_bytree`: [0.6, 1.0]

### 3.3 Early Stopping Enhancement

- Implement adaptive early stopping with dynamic patience
- Monitor both training and validation metrics
- Use rolling window for more stable convergence detection

## 4. Native RMSLE Objective

### 4.1 Current Approach Limitations

- Log transformation of target variable followed by `reg:squarederror`
- Potential for inconsistent gradient computation

### 4.2 Enhanced Approach

**Implementation**:
```python
def rmsle_objective(y_pred, y_true):
    # Custom objective function for RMSLE
    grad = (np.log1p(y_pred) - np.log1p(y_true)) / (y_pred + 1)
    hess = (1 / (y_pred + 1)) * (1 - (np.log1p(y_pred) - np.log1p(y_true)) / (y_pred + 1))
    return grad, hess

def rmsle_eval(y_pred, y_true):
    # Custom evaluation function for RMSLE
    return 'RMSLE', np.sqrt(np.mean((np.log1p(y_pred) - np.log1p(y_true.get_label()))**2))
```

**Benefits**:
- Direct optimization of the evaluation metric
- More consistent gradient computation
- Better convergence properties

## 5. Regularization Parameters

### 5.1 L1 and L2 Regularization

**Parameters to tune**:
- `reg_alpha` (L1 regularization): [0, 10]
- `reg_lambda` (L2 regularization): [0, 10]
- `min_child_weight`: [1, 20]

### 5.2 Tree Complexity Control

**Additional parameters**:
- `gamma` (minimum loss reduction): [0, 5]
- `max_delta_step` (per-leaf output limit): [0, 10]

## 6. Outlier Handling

### 6.1 Detection Methods

1. **Statistical Approach**:
   - Z-score > 3 for numerical features
   - IQR method (1.5 * IQR beyond quartiles)

2. **Model-based Approach**:
   - Isolation Forest for multivariate outlier detection
   - Local Outlier Factor for density-based detection

### 6.2 Handling Strategies

1. **Winsorization**: Cap extreme values at percentiles (1st and 99th)
2. **Robust Scaling**: Use RobustScaler instead of StandardScaler
3. **Sample Weighting**: Reduce influence of outliers during training
